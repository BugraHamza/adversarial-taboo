# AutoTaboo Player

AI plays Taboo games

The language is an ordinary tool for humans. In recent years with the improvement in AI, computers can also make sentences, but a machine has to understand and answer the understood question for a conversation as well. For machines it is still a big challenge in order to answer question, and therefore to communicate human-like. Dialog generation is an subfield of NLP. Sentence generation is a task for dialog generation, but the followings have to be taken into account as well:
- Adequacy
- Fluency
- Diversity

Pragmatics for short.

These properties were less promoted up till now, but are essential to communicate in a context. 

## Game Definitions
Classic(Cooperative) Taboo: In this taboo version, teller takes a card with a word to tell and a bunch of words not to use.

Adversarial Taboo: In this version of taboo, there exists an attacker and a defender. Attacker tells a word and defender tries to find out which word the attacker tends to. If the defender finds the word, it wins. If the defender tells the word, it loses.

## Requirements

1. Dataset Collection (Due Date: 13/02/2022)
- Wikipedia datasets (Tr/En)
- Reddit Conversation dataset (En) (Can be found in tfds)
- Forum DonanÄ±mHaber dataset (will be crawled)
- Convert each dataset to Huggingface dataset format

2. Word Selection

### Adversarial Language Games for Advanced Natural Language Intelligence

Purpose : Providing solution to adversarial taboo, which is proposed in the paper itself.

Summary : We propose Turkish version to Adversarial Taboo game[1]. We implemented the strategies described in the game's paper. 

Target Words Selection -> 563 words from Wiki for OpenQA-based
                          567 words from Reddit for Chatbot-based
                          
Judge System: 
    Fluency check -> Finetuned pretrained GPT2
    Relevancy check (post/response) -> BERT
